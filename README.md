# Docker workshop

This repository contains tasks that are intended to give you some hands-on experience with Docker by building images and running containers.

Each task has its own README with instructions.

Solutions can be found in the corresponding solution folder for each task.

## Prerequisites

Each task assumes that you have Docker installed.

### Windows / macOS
On Windows and macOS you can install [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop)

### Linux
On Linux (Ubuntu) you can follow [this](https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/docker-ce/ubuntu/) guide.

On Linux it's suggested to create a `docker` group and add your user to it in order to run Docker commands as non-root. See instructions on how to do this here: https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/linux-postinstall/
